Supply_Chain_Management

INTRODUCTION:

The project on supply chain management using supervised regression aims to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making within a warehouse network. Leveraging regression models, the system predicts and optimizes various aspects of the supply chain, such as storage issues, transportation issues and resource utilization. By analyzing historical data on warehouse characteristics, location types, capacity sizes, and other relevant factors, the model provides valuable insights into key performance indicators. This predictive approach enables proactive decision-making, allowing for better resource utilization, reducing transport issues, and ultimately improving the overall performance of the supply chain.

OVERVIEW:

A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two
years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and
supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in
inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to
optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

GOALS:

The objective of this project is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an
optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
1. Perform a comprehensive Data Science process, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.
2. Uncover and highlight trends within the dataset, providing valuable insights and innovative approaches employed during the analysis
3. Apply a variety of machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model that determines the optimal product shipment weight.

DATA AND LIBRARIES:

Data: The project uses both a train dataset for model development and a test dataset for evaluation.

Libraries: Key libraries utilized in this project include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

PROJECT:

The aim of this project is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.The project begins with data exploration and cleaning, and then, proceeds to model building, followed by checking relationship between the columns and data preprocessing.
